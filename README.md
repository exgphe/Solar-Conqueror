# Solar-Conqueror

Commander, you were chosen as one of the first testers of the newest solar war simulator. Congratulations! The scale of the war is expanding day by day. In order to protect our home planet, we must be prepared to respond to any enemy from outer skies. This is why this simulation game has been developed.

NOTE: Currently a **Force Touch Trackpad** is required to use the special weapon. iOS target does not support using special weapon.
 
Look forward to your victory, commander!
 
## Developer notes

This is a small game I created in 2017 in order to practice Swift.
